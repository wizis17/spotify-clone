## 🎓 What I Learned

### 1. **React Context API**

- Controlled volume programmatically
- Tracked playback time in real-time with `ontimeupdate` event
- Managed audio element lifecycle

### 3. **CSS Animations & Styling**
- Created custom keyframe animations for audio visualizer bars
- Implemented smooth transitions on hover effects
- Used Tailwind's utility classes for responsive design
- Styled custom range inputs (volume slider)
- Applied brightness filters for green hover effects
- Hidden scrollbars while maintaining functionality

### 4. **Component Architecture**
- Built reusable components (Player, Navbar, Sidebar, Display)
- Separated concerns (display, player, navigation)
- Used props and context for data flow
- Created modular and maintainable code structure

### 5. **Routing & Navigation**
- Implemented React Router for single-page application
- Created dynamic routes for album pages (`/album/:id`)
- Used `useNavigate` hook for programmatic navigation
- Used `useParams` hook to get route parameters

### 6. **User Interface Design**

### 7. **State Management**

- Tracked current song, time, and volume
- Updated UI in real-time based on state changes
- Synchronized audio element with React state

### 8. **Event Handling**
